2] Immediate feedback to the visitors: They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
3] Increased interactivity: You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
4] Richer interfaces: You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
