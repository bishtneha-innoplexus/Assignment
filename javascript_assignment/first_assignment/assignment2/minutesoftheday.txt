problem-statement2: to make a form which takes in input string and have to find numeral associated particular literal and add all of them and print them in output.

time:9:30am

-> since it was the first javascript assignment pretty new concept to us we searched on the internet which fucntionality in html and javascript to use.
->form has to be made using <form></form>.
->making a input type to take input and pass it to the javascript file.
->structure was made in html.
-> had to write logic for javascript. 

time:11:00am

->with jquery it could have been made easily.
->but there was no prior knowledge of jquery.
->so had to find a way in javascript.

time:12:00am

->with javascript function regex could be used to filter out the input and change it accordingly.
->javascript code was done.

time:2:00pm
->str.replace(/\w\S*/g, function(txt){return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1,txt.length-2).toLowerCase() + txt.charAt(txt.length-1).toUpperCase();}); // this logic made my first assignment a success.

time:4:00pm
->i needed to work on the second problem statement.Since i already got a hold on how it worked second assignment made sense a lot.again using regex was the option.

time:6:00pm
->same html template was used only js file was changed.
->logic was to first identify the desired literal.
->second part was to filter the numeral associated with the desired literal.
-> logic makes sense in the code. and it was succesfully done an the code gave correct output.

time:8:00pm
-> work log was logged in and sent to the reporting head .
